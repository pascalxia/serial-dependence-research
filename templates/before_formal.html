		    You have finished all the three practice trials. Now you can start with the formal trials. 
			There will not be feedback after your responses anymore. 
			<b>But please keep the precision required by the practice throughout the survey in order to be qualified for remuneration.</b>
			If you find the practice very hard, feel free to stop here and quit the survey.
